					<p>It's one of those long days and your stomach growls as you scan your fridge.
                        It seems overwhelming and a little stressful to cook, especially on the fly. So you order in. Again.
                        I'm Irina Stoyanova, a creator of this page, where you can find healthy and delicious recepies from fellow food lovers and add your own goodies.
                        As soon as I get home on Saturday mornings with my farmers' market haul, I prep the piles of greens and produce.
                        Wherever you do your shopping, the drill is the same: Wash all the salad and other greens (spinach, kale, chard, etc.), spin dry, roll them into clean dish towels and store them (with the towel) in plastic or produce bags in the fridge. 
                        Often eating healthier doesn't mean having to give up foods you enjoy.  Take your time and find the best recepies here!</p>
